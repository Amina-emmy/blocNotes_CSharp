my simple BlocNotes where you can SAVE, UPLOAD or PRINT a .txt file ; 

you can also COPY & PASTE or CUT the whole content you have wrote ; 

Change font, make it bold , add an underline or erase the whole content 
you can also change the BackGround color.

the slider on the bottom is a BanifuSlider for zoom ; the content will be zoomed , in or out as you slide
